                 <p> I am a B.Tech 3rd-year student at <strong>SCSVMV University,</strong> passionate about becoming an AI/ML engineer. I have a strong interest in learning how machines can think and make decisions. I am gaining hands-on experience by working on projects like a mental health chatbot using Rasa, Flask, and Python. I am also learning how to deploy these projects on platforms like Heroku. My goal is to build AI solutions that can help people and make a positive impact on the world.</p>
